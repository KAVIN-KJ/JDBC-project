# JDBC-project
Console based login and signup program using JDBC
This is a simple JDBC project that gets a username and a password
and stores it in my database. If you are to run this code in your machine,
consider the following: 
* Make sure that you have provided the url username and password of your MySQL database correctly.
* You must create a table named user(s) with two colums. one for username and another for password.
* The datatype of both the colums must be of varchar(30).

Happy coding ✌️😁
